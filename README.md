<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Develop a computer game where two heroes fight each other in the arena.</p>

<h2>Game rules</h2>
<p>The game goes in turns. The two heroes fight each other in turns. Hero 1 attacks hero 2. If hero 2 survives the attack, he attacks back. The game continues until one of the hero dies.</p>

<h2>Attack mechanism</h2>
<p>The hero who attacks unleashes pure damage, measured in points. The hero who is being attacked can take some or all of the damage, depending on his skills.</p>

<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>All heroes have attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health points â€“ when health points go zero or lower, the hero is dead.</li>
<li>Attack points</li>
<li>Armor points</li>
</ul>

<p>When attacking, all heroes do randomly between 80% and 120% of their attack points as raw damage.
When defending, all heroes take damage, reduced randomly with between 80% and 120% of their armor points. The actual damage received reduces their health points. When the health points become zero or less, the hero is dead.</p>

<p>There are at least two types of heroes:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Warrior</dt>
<dt>Knight:</dt>
	<dd>When defending, has a 20% chance to completely block the attack and receive no
damage.</dd>
	<dd>- When attacking, has a 10% chance to do 200% damage.</dd>
<dt>Assassin:</dt>
	<dd>- When attacking, has a 30% chance to do 300% damage.</dd>
<dt>Monk:</dt>
	<dd>- When defending, has a 30% chance to avoid the attack and receive no damage.</dd>
